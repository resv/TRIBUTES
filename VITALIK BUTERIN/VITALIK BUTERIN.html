  <h1 class="text-center">What is Ethereum?</h1>
  <hr class="style-one">
  <p1>
    Vitalik Buterin, has co-founded and invented Ethereum or also called ETH or Either for short. Ethereum is a “decentralised mining network and software development platform rolled into one”. This allows facilitations of newly created cryptocurencies or programs that share a single blockchain.

<!-- 2nd CONTENT (SMART CONTRACTS) -->
<h1 class="text-center">Smart Contracts</h1>
<hr class="style-one">
<p1>
    Ethereum allows one to create new digital tokens that which can hold value as they are used to represent virtual shares, assets and more of the company. As of September 2017, Ethereum was popularily used by many new companies to create "intial-coin-offering"s or also known as "ICO"s. The purpose of ICOs are to represent shares, fundraising, or forms of voting. Companies behind ICOs can decide whether to have a fixed amount of tokens or a fluctuating amount based on predetermined rules.

<!-- 3rd CONTENT (WHY ETHEREUM KICKS, KICKSTARTER) -->
<h1 class="text-center">Why Ethereum kicks, Kickstarter</h1>
<hr class="style-one">
<p1>
    A very strong feature of Ethereum allows developers to raise funds for various projects. Ethereum allows the creation of contracts that abides by the community. The tokens will be held until the goal or agreement has been met upon the agreed date. If the proposed goals fail to meet their deadline, ETH tokens will be released back to the contributors.
    When the middleman such as "Kickstarter" are not a part of the fundraising, Kickstarter's processing fees which can be up to 10% no longer exist.

<!-- 4th CONTENT (POPULAR BITCOIN AGAINST ETHEREUM, THE DIFFERENCE) -->
<h1 class="text-center">Popular Bitcoin against Ethereum Blockchain</h1>
<hr class="style-one">
<p1>
Bitcoin or also known as "BTC" has been and will always be the most popular cryptocurrency. For many new comers, they may not understand the use or  power of cryptocurrency but we can address one less technical aspect by going over a more practical scenario for the everday cash/credit consumer. ETH and BTC both are blockchains, a digital ledger that is recorded in chronological order and also publicly.
<br>
<br>
If a consumer would like to use their BTC to pay for a fancy new watch, they would send their BTC or blockchain-code to the seller's wallet. This transfer process can take up to 10 minutes but usually longer depending on the amount of BTC is being transferred, ETH can handle it in seconds. The BTC blockchain takes longer as the public (or known as miners in this situation) will have to confirm that this transfer has happened. On a positive note, the fee for BTC confirmations would be a fixed amount no matter how many BTC one decides to send.
<br>
<br>
Ethereum's transaction fees are called "gas fees" and on September 2017, the median cost to transfer ETH was $.14 USD for 51 second completion. Paying a few more pennies on gas fees and users can possibly see completed confirmations in as little as 20 seconds.
Ideally we can assume, fees were not intended to be so expensive. Using BTC to pay for a cup of coffee wouldn't be cost effective as a coffee can cost $3 USD and the fee itself could be $5 USD. So in this case ETH might be a better method of payment to get some hot joe.
</p2>
<br>
<br>

<h1 class="text-center">Future Outlook</h1>
<hr class="style-one">
<p1>
This aspect of ETH and BTC are just one out of many differences between them. Many will question which is the better "coin", or dictate which coin should be eradicated, but I can tell you that stacking ETH against BTC, Ethereum looks like it is here for the long haul.
